        <h2>1. The Quiet Revolution Begins</h2>
        <img src="1.1.png" width="400px" height="400px" alt="error">
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> In 1960, the Liberal Party led by Jean Lesage came to power in Quebec. They wanted to make big changes to Quebec schools, healthcare, and the economy. This is when the Quiet Revolution started, a time when many changes in Quebec took place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
        <h2>2. Rise of Quebec Nationalism</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>Before the Quiet Revolution, lots of people in Quebec started to feel that they should have more control over their own things. They wanted Quebec to be its own nation and seperate from the rest of Canada. This idea became stronger during this time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
        <h2>3. The Duplessis Era</h2>
        <img src="1.2.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" alt="error">
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Maurice Duplessis was the leader of Quebec from 1944 to 1959. He kept things normal and didn't want big changes. Many people in Quebec were unhappy with how things were being ran by him, which made them want change even more when Jean Lesage took over.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
        <h2>4. The Role of the Catholic Church </h2>
        <img src="catholic.png", height="400 px", width = "400 px" alt="">
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Before 1960, the Catholic Church was very powerful in Quebec. It controlled schools and lots of other services. By the time of the Quiet Revolution started, the government started to take control of these things, and the Churchâ€™s influence started to fade.</p>
